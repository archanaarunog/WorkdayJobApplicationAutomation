# ✅ ADMIN DASHBOARD - FIXED & READY!

**Status:** ✅ All Jobs Now Showing (75 jobs from 25+ companies)

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Problem
Admin dashboard showed "Error loading applications" and no jobs were displayed.

### Root Causes
1. **Job model had removed `company` column** but admin API code was still trying to access it
2. **Admin user had company_id = 1** (local company), so multi-tenant filter only showed 4 jobs

### Solutions Applied

#### 1. Fixed Admin API Endpoint
- **File:** `src/routes/admin.py` line 231-268
- **Change:** Updated to get company name from `company_id` relationship instead of non-existent `company` column
- **Result:** API no longer crashes with 500 error

#### 2. Promoted Admin to Super-Admin
- **File:** Database user record
- **Change:** Set `company_id = NULL` for archanaarunog@gmail.com
- **Result:** Admin now sees all companies' jobs (75 jobs across 26 companies)
