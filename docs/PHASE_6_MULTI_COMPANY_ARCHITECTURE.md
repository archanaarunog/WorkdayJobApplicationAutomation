# Phase 6: Multi-Company Architecture Implementation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Branch:** v1.1.0

## Overview

Phase 6 introduces multi-tenancy support to the Job Application Portal System (JAPS), enabling multiple companies to use the same system with complete data isolation. Each company has its own isolated data space, admin users, and customizable settings.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- ✅ Added `Company` model with comprehensive fields and relationships
- ✅ Added `company_id` foreign key to User, Job, and Application models
- ✅ Created proper relationships between all models
- ✅ Implemented database migration script for existing data

### 2. Authentication & Authorization Enhancements
- ✅ Updated JWT tokens to include `company_id`, `user_id`, and `is_admin`
- ✅ Enhanced authentication middleware for company-level access control
- ✅ Implemented token validation to prevent cross-company access
- ✅ Auto-assignment of new users to default company

### 3. Multi-Tenant Utility Functions
- ✅ Created comprehensive utility functions for data filtering
- ✅ Implemented company access validation
- ✅ Added automatic company_id assignment for new records
- ✅ Built company statistics and validation functions

### 4. API Endpoints - Company Management
- ✅ GET `/api/admin/companies` - List all companies with statistics
- ✅ GET `/api/admin/companies/{id}` - Get detailed company information
- ✅ POST `/api/admin/companies` - Create new company
- ✅ PATCH `/api/admin/companies/{id}` - Update company information
- ✅ PATCH `/api/admin/companies/{id}/settings` - Update company settings
- ✅ DELETE `/api/admin/companies/{id}` - Delete company (with safeguards)

### 5. Updated Existing Endpoints for Multi-Tenancy
- ✅ All admin endpoints now filter by company_id
- ✅ Job management endpoints respect company boundaries
- ✅ User management endpoints enforce company isolation
- ✅ Application endpoints filter by company context
- ✅ Public job listing requires authentication and company context

### 6. Frontend - Company Management Interface
- ✅ Added "Company Management" tab to admin dashboard
- ✅ Company listing with statistics and search/filter functionality
- ✅ Company creation modal with comprehensive form fields
- ✅ Company details modal with activity tracking
- ✅ Company editing and status management
- ✅ Company deletion with confirmation and data impact display

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Migration
```bash
# Run migration script
cd services/meta-service
python migrate_to_multicompany.py
```

**Migration Features:**
- Automatically creates backup of existing database
- Adds company_id columns to existing tables
- Creates default company for existing data
- Migrates all existing records to default company
- Sets up proper relationships and constraints
- Validates migration success

### Company Model Structure
```python
class Company(Base):
    id: int (Primary Key)
    name: str (Unique)
    domain: str (Unique, Optional)
    slug: str (Unique)
    description: str (Optional)
    industry: str (Optional)
    website: str (Optional)
    headquarters: str (Optional)
    size: str (Optional)
    admin_user_id: int (Foreign Key, Optional)
    settings: JSON (Flexible configuration)
    is_active: bool
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
```

### JWT Token Enhancement
```python
# New JWT payload structure
{
    "sub": "user@example.com",
    "company_id": 1,
    "user_id": 123,
    "is_admin": true,
    "exp": 1698765432
}
```

### Multi-Tenant Data Filtering
All data queries now use company-aware filtering:
```python
# Example usage
filtered_query = filter_by_company(
    query=db.query(Job),
    model=Job,
    company_id=user_company_id,
    user_is_admin=is_admin
)
```

## Security Features

### 1. Data Isolation
- **Complete Separation:** Each company's data is completely isolated
- **Access Control:** Users can only access data from their assigned company
- **Admin Boundaries:** Company admins can only manage their company's data
- **Cross-Company Prevention:** JWT validation prevents token reuse across companies

### 2. Company Admin Controls
- **User Management:** Company admins can manage users within their company
- **Job Management:** Full CRUD operations for company jobs
- **Application Oversight:** View and manage applications for company jobs
- **Settings Control:** Customize company-specific configurations

### 3. Super Admin Features
- **System-Wide Access:** Super admins (no company_id) can access all data
- **Company Management:** Create, edit, and delete companies
- **User Assignment:** Assign users to different companies
- **Global Oversight:** Monitor system-wide statistics and activity

## Company Settings Configuration

Each company can customize:
```json
{
    "job_posting_approval_required": false,
    "allow_external_applications": true,
    "email_notifications": true,
    "branding_color": "#007bff",
    "logo_url": null,
    "custom_application_fields": []
}
```

## Frontend User Experience

### Company Management Interface
1. **Dashboard Tab:** Company statistics and overview
2. **Company Listing:** Searchable table with filtering options
3. **Company Creation:** Comprehensive form with validation
4. **Company Details:** Modal with statistics and recent activity
5. **Settings Management:** Company-specific configuration options

### Enhanced Security UX
- **Seamless Experience:** Users see only their company's data
- **No Cross-Contamination:** Impossible to access other companies' information
- **Clear Company Context:** Company information displayed in interface
- **Admin Boundaries:** Clear indication of admin scope and permissions

## API Response Examples
