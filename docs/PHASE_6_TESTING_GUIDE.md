# Phase 6 - Multi-Company Architecture Implementation Guide

## Overview
Phase 6 successfully implements a complete multi-tenant (multi-company) architecture for the Job Application Portal System. This allows multiple companies to use the same system with complete data isolation.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates ✅
- **New Company Model**: Added comprehensive company management with fields for name, domain, settings, admin assignment
- **Foreign Key Updates**: Added `company_id` to Users, Jobs, and Applications tables
- **Migration Script**: Created automated migration that safely updates existing data
- **Default Company**: Existing data is migrated to a "Default Company" automatically

### 2. Backend API Enhancements ✅
- **Company CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, delete operations for companies
- **Enhanced Authentication**: JWT tokens now include `company_id`, `user_id`, and `is_admin` for proper access control
- **Multi-Tenant Utilities**: Created helper functions for data filtering and access validation
- **Company-Aware Endpoints**: All existing endpoints now filter data by company context

### 3. Frontend Admin Dashboard ✅
- **New Company Management Tab**: Complete interface for managing companies
- **Company Statistics**: Real-time stats showing users, jobs, and applications per company
- **Company Creation Modal**: Form to create new companies with validation
- **Company Details View**: Detailed view of each company with recent activity

### 4. Data Isolation & Security ✅
- **Automatic Filtering**: All data queries are automatically filtered by company_id
- **Access Control**: Users can only see data from their own company
- **Admin Segregation**: Company admins can only manage their own company's data
- **Token Security**: JWT tokens prevent cross-company data access

## New Features Added

### Admin Dashboard - Companies Tab
1. **Company Listing Table** with:
   - Company name, domain, status
   - User count, job count, application count
   - Admin user assignment
   - Created date and activity status

2. **Company Creation** with fields:
   - Company name (required, unique)
   - Domain (optional, unique)
   - URL slug (required, unique)
   - Description, industry, headquarters
   - Company size classification
   - Admin user assignment

3. **Company Statistics Cards**:
   - Total companies count
   - Active companies count
   - Total users across all companies
   - System-wide application count

### API Endpoints Added
```
GET    /api/admin/companies           - List all companies
POST   /api/admin/companies           - Create new company
GET    /api/admin/companies/{id}      - Get company details
PATCH  /api/admin/companies/{id}      - Update company
DELETE /api/admin/companies/{id}      - Delete company
PATCH  /api/admin/companies/{id}/settings - Update company settings
```

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Backend Running**: Make sure your FastAPI server is running on port 8000
2. **Frontend Running**: Make sure your frontend server is running on port 8081
3. **Fresh Database**: The migration has been run and default company created

### Testing Steps

#### 1. Test Basic Admin Access
```bash
# Login as admin user and verify you can access admin dashboard
http://localhost:8081/admin-dashboard.html
```

#### 2. Test Company Management Tab
1. **Navigate to Companies Tab**:
   - Click on "Company Management" tab in admin dashboard
   - Verify you see the default company listed
   - Check that statistics cards show correct counts

2. **Create a New Company**:
   - Click "Create New Company" button
   - Fill in the form:
     ```
     Name: Test Company Inc
     Domain: testcompany.com
     Slug: test-company
     Description: Test company for multi-tenancy
     Industry: Technology
     ```
   - Submit and verify company appears in the list

#### 3. Test Multi-Tenancy Features
1. **Create Users for Different Companies**:
   ```bash
   # Register new users (they'll be assigned to default company)
   # Then use admin to create another company and move users
   ```

2. **Test Data Isolation**:
   - Create jobs for different companies
   - Verify users only see jobs from their company
   - Test application submission across companies

#### 4. Test Company Administration
1. **Assign Company Admin**:
   - In company details, assign a user as company admin
   - Login as that user and verify they can manage their company

2. **Test Admin Boundaries**:
   - Company admin should only see their company's data
   - Super admin should see all companies' data

#### 5. Test Authentication Changes
1. **Verify JWT Tokens**:
   ```bash
   # Check that login tokens now include company_id
   # Test that users can't access other companies' data
   ```

2. **Test Token Validation**:
   - Try modifying token company_id (should fail)
   - Test token expiration and refresh

### Key Testing Areas

#### Data Isolation ✅
- [ ] Users only see their company's jobs
- [ ] Applications are filtered by company
- [ ] Admin functions respect company boundaries
- [ ] Cross-company data access is prevented

#### Company Management ✅
- [ ] Create new companies successfully
- [ ] Update company information
- [ ] Assign and change company admins
- [ ] Company statistics are accurate
- [ ] Company settings can be modified

#### User Experience ✅
- [ ] Existing users continue to work normally
- [ ] New registrations are assigned to default company
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows appropriate data
- [ ] Company tab loads and functions correctly

#### Security ✅
- [ ] JWT tokens contain proper company context
- [ ] Cross-company access is blocked
- [ ] Admin privileges are company-scoped
- [ ] Super admin can access all data

## Potential Issues to Check

### 1. Migration Issues
```bash
# If you encounter issues, check:
- Database backup was created
- All tables have company_id columns
- Default company exists
- Existing data is properly migrated
```

### 2. Authentication Problems
```bash
# If login issues occur:
- Clear browser localStorage
- Check JWT token format in browser dev tools
- Verify backend is using updated authentication
```

### 3. Frontend Issues
```bash
# If admin dashboard problems:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify API endpoints are responding
- Test with browser dev tools network tab
```

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur, you can rollback using:
1. **Database**: Restore from the backup created during migration
2. **Code**: Revert to the previous git commit
3. **Frontend**: The changes are additive, so removing the Companies tab won't break existing functionality

## Next Steps After Testing
Once you've verified everything works:
1. Test thoroughly with real data scenarios
2. Consider adding company branding features
3. Implement company-specific settings
4. Add company invitation/user assignment features
5. Consider adding company analytics and reporting
