# Multi-Portal Job Application System: Architecture & Roadmap

## Overview
This document describes the high-level architecture, project phases, and automation strategy for building and testing three company job portals (e.g., Meta, Google, Amazon) with a unified automation suite. It is intended for SDET/SDE learning and demonstration.

## 1. System Architecture Diagram

```
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
|   Meta Portal     |      |  Google Portal    |      |  Amazon Portal    |
| (FastAPI + JS UI) |      | (FastAPI + JS UI) |      | (FastAPI + JS UI) |
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
         |                        |                        |
         +------------------------+------------------------+
                                  |
                        +----------------------+
                        |  Automation Suite    |
                        |  (Selenium/Pytest)   |
                        +----------------------+
```

- Each portal is a standalone web app (backend + frontend).
- The automation suite interacts with all portals for end-to-end testing.

---

## 2. Project Phases

### Phase 1: Meta Portal (Current)
- User registration & login (JWT)
- Job listing (view all jobs)
- Apply button (UI only, backend in V1.1)
- Logout functionality
- Responsive UI (Bootstrap)
- API docs (Swagger UI)
- CORS enabled

### Phase 2: Additional Portals
- Clone Meta Portal structure for Google and Amazon portals
- Update branding, endpoints, and data as needed
- Ensure consistent API and UI patterns

### Phase 3: Automation Suite
- Build a unified automation suite (e.g., Selenium + Pytest)
- Automate registration, login, job listing, and (eventually) application flows for all portals
- Design reusable test cases and page objects

## 3. Detailed Component Diagram

```
+-------------------+         +-------------------+
|   Frontend (JS)   | <-----> |   Backend (API)   |
|  (HTML/CSS/JS)    |         |   (FastAPI)       |
+-------------------+         +-------------------+
         ^                             ^
         |                             |
         +-----------------------------+
                       |
              +----------------+
              |  SQLite DB     |
              +----------------+
```

- Each portal has its own frontend, backend, and database.
- The automation suite interacts with the frontend (browser-level).

---

## 4. Automation Suite Design

- **Framework:** Selenium WebDriver + Pytest (Python)
- **Structure:**
  - Page Object Model for each portal
  - Common utility functions (login, register, apply, etc.)
  - Test data management
- **Test Coverage:**
  - Registration, login, job listing, logout (all portals)
  - Application flow (when implemented)
- **Reporting:**
  - HTML reports, screenshots on failure

## 5. Roadmap & Milestones

| Phase   | Deliverable                        | Status      |
|---------|------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1       | Meta Portal MVP                    | Complete    |
| 2       | Google & Amazon Portals            | Planned     |
| 3       | Unified Automation Suite           | Planned     |
| 4       | Job Application Backend/Frontend   | Planned     |
| 5       | Advanced Features & Reporting      | Planned     |

---

## 6. Future Enhancements
- User profile and application history
- Admin features (job management)
- CI/CD integration for automation
- Deployment to cloud (optional)
