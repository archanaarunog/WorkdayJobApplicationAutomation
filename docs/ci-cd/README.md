## High-Level Plan for CI Enhancements

### Overview
This plan outlines enhancements to the CI pipeline to ensure quality during ongoing updates and bug fixes. It's designed for learning, starting from understanding the current setup and building up to advanced checks.

### Phases
1. **Understand and Document Current Setup** (Foundation)
2. **Add One Simple Test Case** (Hands-On Testing)
3. **Code Quality Gates** (Simple Configs)
4. **Security Basics** (Optional Next)

## Features by Phase

### Phase 1: Understand and Document Current Setup
- Review `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Run CI steps locally
- Examine smoke tests
- Document findings in this README

### Phase 2: Add One Simple Test Case
- User Auth & Job Application Flow test
- Uses pytest fixtures for seeded data
- Covers register → login → apply → verify

### Phase 3: Code Quality Gates
- Blocking Ruff linting
- Basic mypy type checking
- Enforces code standards

### Phase 4: Security Basics
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static security analysis

## Todo List
- [ ] Phase 1: Document current CI
- [ ] Phase 1: Run local CI steps
- [ ] Phase 1: Examine tests
- [ ] Phase 1: Update README
- [ ] Phase 2: Add user auth test
- [ ] Phase 3: Make Ruff blocking
- [ ] Phase 3: Add mypy
- [ ] Phase 4: Add safety scan

## Low-Level Steps (Phase 1)

### Task 1: Read and Summarize the CI Workflow File
- Open `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Note each section (e.g., checkout, setup Python, install deps, import check, lint, run tests)
- Understand YAML and GitHub Actions syntax

### Task 2: Run CI Steps Locally
- Run import check: `python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.append('services/meta-service'); import src.main as m; print('Import OK')"`
- Run tests: `python3 -m pytest -q tests`
- Note outputs and errors

### Task 3: Examine the Smoke Tests Code
- Open `services/meta-service/tests/test_smoke_api.py`
- Understand pytest, async, httpx
- Summarize each test

### Task 4: Explore Related Codebase Parts
- Look at `src/main.py`, `src/routes/job.py`, `src/config/database.py`
- Note key components

### Task 5: Update This README
- Add summaries from Tasks 1-4
- Include explanations and code snippets

## Future Phases
- Phase 2-4 as outlined above
- Update this doc after each phase
