2. Develop automated testing framework
3. Implement complete SDLC/STLC processes
4. Build portfolio-ready project for interviews

### Secondary Objectives
1. Master Git workflows and collaboration
2. Learn modern development tools and frameworks
3. Practice system design and architecture
4. Develop technical documentation skills

## Project Scope
### In Scope
- Mock job application website with core features:
  - User registration/login
  - Job posting and browsing
  - Application submission
  - Basic profile management
- Automated testing framework covering:
  - UI testing with Selenium/Playwright
  - API testing with Pytest
  - Performance testing basics
- CI/CD pipeline setup:
  - GitHub Actions (primary)
  - Azure DevOps Pipelines (enterprise alternative)
- Comprehensive documentation

### Out of Scope
